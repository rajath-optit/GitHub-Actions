# Node.js GitHub Actions Example

This is a sample Node.js application with a basic GitHub Actions CI setup.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-repo.git
```

2. Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

3. Run tests:
```
npm test
```
## GitHub Actions Workflow

The project includes a GitHub Actions CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) that automates the build and test process whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch or a pull request is opened.
Steps to Set Up and Run:
Clone the repository (if you haven't already):

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-repo.git
cd my-repo
```
Create the GitHub Actions Workflow:

Create the .github/workflows/ci.yml file with the content above.
Create package.json, .gitignore, and README.md files:

Set them up as shown in the examples above.
Commit and Push:

Stage your files and push them to GitHub:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions workflow and project setup"
git push origin main
```

Check the Actions Tab:

After pushing the changes, go to the Actions tab in your GitHub repository to see the status of the workflow. If everything is set up correctly, it will trigger the CI process to build and run the tests.
